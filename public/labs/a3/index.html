<h1>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
<h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>
<h3>Style attribute</h3>
<p><!--style="background-color: blue; color: white" "Despite this change the entire p color is set"-->
  Style attribute allows configuring look
  and feel right on the element. Although it's
  very convenient it is considered bad practice
  and you should avoid using the style attribute
</p>
<h3>Style tag</h3>
<p>
  A slightly better way to configure look and feel
  is to declare CSS rules in the STYLE tag in the
  header and then refer to the tag by their name,
  ID, or class This paragraph's style is set by a
  rule referring to the P tags
